## Mini Project - Milestone 2
The project begins investigation and analysis into the flow_sample data set by addressing the posed research questions from Milestone 1. Each research question was explored by summarising the data and by graphing the summarised results. Then, the data was identified as tidy, and subsequently untidied. Further research questions for Milestone 3 were identified.

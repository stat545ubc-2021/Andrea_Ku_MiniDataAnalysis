## Purpose
This Mini Project will focus on learning how to run a small data analysis with data provided by the datateachr package.

## Mini Project 1
In Deliverable 1, there is an RMD file that walks through looking at the data, choosing the data, and running preliminary explorations to find research questions. 

### How to run code in the rmd file
The code is contained in an rmd file, which can be run in RStudio.

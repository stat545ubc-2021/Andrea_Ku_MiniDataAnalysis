## Purpose
This Mini Project will focus on learning how to run a small data analysis with data provided by the datateachr package. In this project, I chose the flow_sample data set that was acquired from The Government of Canada's Historical Hydrometric Database. 

## Mini Project - Milsetone 1
The project is an introduction to the data set options, and begins an initial exploration of the chosen data set. The RMD file walks through looking at the data, choosing the data, and running preliminary explorations to find research questions. 

## Mini Project - Milsetone 2
The project begins investigation and analysis into the flow_sample data set by addressing the posed research questions from Milestone 1. Each research question was explored by summarising the data and by graphing the summarised results. Then, the data was identified as tidy, and subsequently untidied. Further research questions for Milestone 3 were identified.
